our topic is emergency services on click, current system of emergency service is like first of all when we need any emergency service like 108 service and fire brigade service then we have to call at particular number which will redirect to head station of that service (for 108 service head office is ahmedabad and for fire brigade head station is city wise, for surat that is mugalisara) and we have to provide incident place's address and they will provide it to particular area wise fire station and like wise they will provide emergency services.so, we implemented an application in which by clicking of emergency service's button and then location of incident place is directly transfer to the admin side and they provide it to nearest fire station and they will directly serve to you by your location and  moreover we implemented that by calling only location is directly transfer to the same as above (no need of provide address).
